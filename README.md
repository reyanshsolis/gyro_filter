1.	Kalman Filter based Bias Correction for Gyroscope
		
		This contains the code for using Linear Kalman Filter for estimating the bias present in gyroscope data. Here we take the x, y and z axis data from the gyroscope when the bot is at rest. The data is used in combination with linear kalman filter to estimate the initial bias in the data and then this bias is subtracted from the incoming data to obtain the corrected output.

2.	Noise Reduction of MEMS Gyroscope Based on Direct Modeling
    for an Angular Rate Signal
		
		This contains the code for using a novel approach for processing the outputs signal of the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscopes to reduce the bias drift and noise. The principle for the noise reduction was presented, and an optimal Kalman filter (KF) was designed by a steady-state filter gain obtained from the analysis of
		KF observability. In particular, the true angular rate signal was directly modeled to obtain an optimal estimate and make a self-compensation for the gyroscope without needing other sensorâ€™s information, whether in static or dynamic condition.
